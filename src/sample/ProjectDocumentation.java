    //DOCUMENTATION CLASS

    //Design Patterns:
    /*
    * Decorator - Adding functionality to Player/NPC
    * Example.
    * Player chooses a new class, giving them new abilities.
    *
    * Player dual-classes, giving two classes abilities
    *
    * Factory - Simplify creation of different NPCs
    * Example.
    * We have a standard Knight NPC and standard Rook npc
    * XNPC = Factory.createKnight()/createRook();
    *
    *
    *
    * 
    * */
